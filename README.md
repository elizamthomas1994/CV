## Eliza Thomas

An extremely ambitious individual with a background in administration and customer service. I am looking to kickstart a new career as a Fullstack Junior Software Developer as I absolutely love problem solving and wanted to challenge myself under a field I love; technology. I am a dedicated and hard-working team player with a passion to constantly expand on experiences and knowledge.

Currently, I am studying under a 12 week software development course at Makers Academy, to build upon skills that I started building during the pandemic.
