## Eliza Thomas

An extremely ambitious individual with a background in administration and customer service. I am looking to kickstart a new career as a Fullstack Junior Software Developer as I absolutely love problem solving and wanted to challenge myself under a field I love; technology. I am a dedicated and hard-working team player with a passion to constantly expand on experiences and knowledge.

Currently, I am studying under a 12 week software development course at Makers Academy, to build upon skills that I started building during the pandemic.

- Was later assigned to oversee Merlin Entertainments locations based in Oceania and North America in recognition of consistently high-quality performance throughout my tenure.
- Became part of a small team that aided in providing support for "Merlin Annual Pass" users which resulted in an increase in the daily number of resolved requests, and a decrease in workload for the general support team.

## Skills

- Adaptability - I am a very fast learner and am quick to adapt to different environments, as demonstrated by my experience working with large teams on an international basis at Merlin, to working in an incredibly small team to Toshiba, to studying abroad in Spain.
