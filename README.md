## Eliza Thomas

An extremely ambitious individual with a background in administration and customer service. I am looking to kickstart a new career as a Full-Stack Junior Software Developer as I really enjoy problem solving and wanted to challenge myself in a field I love; technology. I am a dedicated and hard-working team player with a passion to constantly expand on experiences and knowledge.

Recently, I have graduated from a 16 week software development course at Makers Academy, to improve upon skills that I started building during the pandemic.

## Skills

- Communication - I have 3 years experience communicating with customers and team members alike using a variety of methods, and am able to clearly and concisely communicate concepts and other information, as well as build rapport in order to increase productivity. When working in tech, I use these communication skills to work closely with team members to build clean, readable code, as well as using agile techniques such as pair programming to code as efficiently as possible.

- Adaptability - I am a very fast learner and am quick to adapt to different environments, as demonstrated by my experience working with large teams on an international basis at Merlin, to working in an incredibly small team to Toshiba, to studying abroad in Spain, through to utilising a variety of different tech stacks within a 16 week software development course at Makers Academy.
